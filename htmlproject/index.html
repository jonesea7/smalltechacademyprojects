        <body>
            <p>There once was a cat named Muffins</p>
            <p>
                She <strong>always</strong> pulled out all the stuffings</p>
                <p>When the evening would come</p>
                <p>She'd scratch on my bum</p>
                <p>and all my worries were for nothing
            </p>
